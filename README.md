### Edward Gunn Task Solution
# Thoughts and assumptions
----------------------------------------------------------------
I really enjoyed this task, I was a nice break from the usual leetcode style coding tests. 

I completed the first exercise so that the program recognises vehicles and adds the appropriate markup as well as an extra test to make sure that prices varies correctly by vehicle. I assumed that the price was desired to be a Long value so the solution accomodates this.

The webpage I created is hopefully fairly user friendly, after running `gradle bootRun` go to `http://localhost:8080/`.

The input shouldn't recognise any empty inputs and for the vehicle only the desired inputs should be possible. I am very pleased with the animations.
